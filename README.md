# Statistical Analysis in Python with Real-World Datasets

Welcome to the **Statistical Analysis in Python with Real-World Datasets** repository! This project provides a comprehensive suite of tools and examples for performing statistical analysis on real-world datasets using Python.

## Overview

This repository includes Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate various statistical techniques and analyses applied to real-world datasets. The goal is to provide practical examples and insights into statistical methods using popular Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, StatsModels, and Seaborn.

## Features

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculate and interpret summary statistics such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.
- **Inferential Statistics**: Perform hypothesis testing including t-tests, ANOVA, and chi-square tests.
- **Regression Analysis**: Fit and evaluate linear and logistic regression models.
- **Visualization**: Create visualizations to illustrate relationships between variables, including scatter plots, box plots, and regression lines.
- **Real-World Datasets**: Examples use real-world datasets to demonstrate the application of statistical methods.

## Datasets

The project includes real-world dataset, such as:

- **Heart Disease Dataset**: Contains information about patients' heart disease risk factors and outcomes.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/statistical-analysis-python.git
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can use `pip` to install them:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scipy statsmodels seaborn matplotlib
   ```

3. **Explore Notebooks and Scripts**:
   - Open the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts in your preferred environment.
   - Follow the examples to learn about different statistical techniques.

4. **Run Analyses**:
   - Load the datasets and run the provided analyses.
   - Modify the scripts to suit your own data and analysis needs.

## Examples

### 1. Descriptive Statistics
   Calculate mean, median, variance, standard deviation, range, skewness and kurtosis for a dataset.
   
### 2. Inferential Stastics

##### Hypothesis Testing
Perform t-tests to compare groups and interpret the results.

##### Regression Analysis
Fit linear regression models to understand relationships between variables and predict outcomes.

### 4. Visualizations
   Create scatter plots with regression lines and box plots to illustrate data distributions and relationships.
